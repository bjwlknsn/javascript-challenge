The group `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected eye-witness reports of UFOs. The group requested code that will create a table dynamically based upon the data provided. They also needed their users to filter the table data by date. Per their request, the code could only use pure JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js. 

### Automatic Table and Date Search

* Created a basic HTML web page using the index.html file provided as a starting point.

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to the web page, and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * The table has a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* A date form was used in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will filter for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
